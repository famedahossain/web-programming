                <p>I have owned a lot of digital cameras over the years - Nikon D50, D90, D3, D800, Df, Canon 5DMKIII, etc. Some of those cameras have disappointed -- the D90 with it's CMOS sensor seemed less sharp than the old school CCD in the D50, and even the D800 with its antialias filter seemed less sharp than I expected.

                <br>
                With the D850, I was impressed the second I took the first shot inside my dimly lit home after dark. Incredible detail, excellent noise, perfectly metered, impressively fast autofocus. 10/10.

                <br>
                The image quality is a total game changer. Even though the linear resolution increase over my D800 is modest, there is an inherent sharpness and pixel level contrast that I almost never saw with the D800.</p>

                <p>After a few months of almost daily use, I can confidently rate this camera as the best camera I have ever owned. I have used it in the rain, in the salt spray from ocean waves and the mist from waterfalls, it has held up well and it's weather sealing is excellent. The color and dynamic range are amazing. The native low ISO of 64 adds so much to my landscape photography, such clean images. At high ISO settings for night sky and nighttime architecture, the images are still c lean and have far less noise than other cameras I have used. The built in intervelometer is versatile and can be set to a wide variety of shooting situations. The built in time lapse feature is great for a hassle free time lapse, it is easy to program and does a good job. The in camera multiple shot mode is very useful for stacking exposures that can produce a "long exposure" effect without using an ND filter.</p>
